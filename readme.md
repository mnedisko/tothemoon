Adding Moon Image Around Detected Objects with Object Detection and Classification


This project aims to detect objects on a video stream using object detection and classification models, and then add a moon image around the detected objects.

Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

Install Python 3.6 or above.
Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:
pip install opencv-python numpy torch torchvision ultralytics
Usage
When the project is launched, a video stream will be opened, and objects will be detected using object detection and classification models. For each detected object, a moon image will be added around it, and classification results will be displayed on the screen. Additionally, the output video file will be saved as 'output.mp4'.

To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal:
python main.py
A window with the video stream will open, and the processing will begin. Press 'q' on the keyboard to exit.
